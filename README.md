<!-- About Project -->

The Blood Donation Application is a comprehensive platform designed to streamline blood donation activities, fostering a seamless connection between donors and individuals in need of blood. Implemented using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), the application features user-friendly registration, authentication, and role-based access control. It empowers users with distinct rolesâ€”Admins with comprehensive access, Donors who can register and manage donation requests, and Volunteers responsible for creating and overseeing donation requests.

Noteworthy functionalities include responsive dashboards tailored for different user roles, efficient database integration using MongoDB, dynamic blood donation request management with varying statuses, and a robust content management system for creating and publishing blogs. The application prioritizes user experience, security, and responsiveness, contributing to a purpose-driven platform that bridges the gap between donors and those seeking blood donations.
